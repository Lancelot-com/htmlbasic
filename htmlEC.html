    <td>A resistor is used to:
      Limit or control electric current in a circuit.
      Divide voltage across components.
      Protect sensitive devices from excess current.
      Generate heat in devices like heaters.
      Adjust signal levels in electronic circuits</td>

    <td>Capacitors are used to:
      Store energy: Act as small energy reservoirs in electronic circuits.
      Filter signals: Remove noise or smooth voltage in power supplies.
      Timing circuits: Control the timing in devices like clocks or oscillators.
      Coupling/Decoupling: Allow AC signals to pass while blocking DC or stabilize voltage.
      Power factor correction: Improve efficiency in AC power systems.</td>

      a circuit on or off, allowing users to 
      control the flow of electricity in a 
      device by essentially "making" or "breaking" 
      an electrical connection, commonly seen 
      in everyday applications like turning on lights,
       appliances, or controlling machinery in 
       industrial settings. </td>
